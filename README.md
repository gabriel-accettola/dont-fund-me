# dont fund me / dont fund this

We are committed to developing sustainable solutions using free open source software along with one local middle school, one high school, and one college in,
- Africa
- India 
- Indonesia 
- Europe 
- North America

Our organisation has three main area of interest,
1. Housing
2. Education
3. Income

### Housing
In the housing initiative our goal is the ability for anyone, anywhere, to be able to build a home that by today's
standards would be considered the kind of home only the very wealthy are able to afford using only natural, sustainable, materials.
This year we are focusing on a hybrid technique using 'Nebraska straw bale construction', rice, and 'construction grade bamboo'

### Education
In the education initiative our goal is to create, or assist with the creation of, a complete education on audio format in every native language.  
Similar to the educational material available in many countries by organizations similar to Khan Academy, with a focus of being offline-first and available in an audio format such that older commodity phones are able to play.
Too many family worldwide are unable to send their children or themselves to formal schooling, and too many do not have consistent access to the high speed internet connections where this education is available for free.  
With a complete audio education in each language available we believe we can help improve these situations.

Additionally, the education initiative is sponsoring 1 report from each of the 15 school worldwide once a year from 2024/2025 until 2039/2040.
Our goal is to provide the funding for a report, paper, or project by the students which will form a significant portion of a public longitudinal study.
Each year one student from each school will be awarded 100 euro, either the schools or the students will pick the winner, all report will be made available public anonymously.

We do not have all the answers, we suspect that our children either have them or will have them.

### Income
In the income initiative our goal is to create, or assist with the creation of, an end to end system which allows for families to be paid for their available solar and compute.
Sustainable reoccurring month income is a difficult for most of the world while the demand for power and compute is rising dramatically, there are already systems in place where
people can use their existing low power and older devices to earn a small reoccurring income yet the knowledge of these systems appears to be missing except for in dense population center.
Low power and relatively inexpensive computers, similar to raspberry pi, are quite capable of being put to use to help families and villages earn passive income.

### Current plan
Establish long term rental/lease contracts, build and practice building multifamily / multi-generation homes.
Engage local communities and the public schools nearest each location to help extend existing solution as available.

| Location      | City      | Land agreements     | Board members |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Africa        | tba       | Active / Q4 2024    | Adama         |
| India         | Chennai   | Ready               | Venky         |
| Indonesia     | Pejeng    | Active / Q2 2024    | Nyoman        |
| Europe        | Haarlem   | Active / Q3 2024    | Nandini       |
| North America | tba       | Pending / Q1 2025   | Anna          |

### Details
On a 25-meter by 25-meter plot of land,
- How could you build a home with little to no cost?
- How could you plan and build 4 homes on that same plot?

### Current direction
- Plant a series of construction grade bamboo plants that will both grow into the house design and be used in place of traditional wood for flooring and for water purification using bamboo charcoal.
- Grow or purchase rice or wheat straw to be used in Nebraska style bale construction for both it's load bearing and insulation properties.
- A small solar cell to power a small water pump to push water into a series charcoal barrels, then a small heater, then onto a rooftop storage tank.
- An older commodity phone with the smallest sharable internet contract available
- Low cost commodity hardware, raspberry pi 5, to running compute for a cloud provider.
- no steel, as little as possible
- no cement, as little as possible
- no batteries, as few as possible       

### Funding
We are fully funded.  If you would like to help please consider giving to a local charity, or maybe Unicef.
Our NGO application is pending in the Netherlands and is expected to be complete Q2 2024.
